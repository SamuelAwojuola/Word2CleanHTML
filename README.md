# Word2CleanHTML
This is to have an offline MS Word to Html converter to make creating and uploading files to my github repository easier.
## Set Up
It requires that the repository with the layout and categories already be created. These then will be made into a select list from which the relevant the desired layout and category is selected. 
There are two versions here,
1. "Word2CleanHTML JSON.html" which generates the categories and layouts from a JSON file (githubLayoutsCategories.json) in the root directory. You can edit JSON file.
2. "Word2CleanHTML.html" which does not use any JSON file. To modify the layouts and categories list, you have to edit the html file itself.
